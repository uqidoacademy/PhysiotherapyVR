# PhysiotherapyVR

The goal of this VR project is to made more funny and intaractive physiotearpy exercises. Physioterapy session is long and ripetitive so
patients become bored very soon. With VR technologies and gamification we think that the exercise can become more interesting and can help 
physiotherapist to control the right patient movement with extreme precision. 

The application is divided in two part: Desktop and VR.
The Desktop part is developed for physiotherapist, where he can select patient, body part, set up trakers, register the right exercise and
control right movement of every limb part.
The VR part is for patient: with HTC Vive headset and trakers he can do the exercise in a funny world tha help him to do the right movement
with realtime simulations and informations.
