# PhysiotherapyVR

The goal of this VR project is to made more funny and intaractive physiotearpy exercises. Physioterapy session is long and ripetitive so
patients become bored very soon. With VR technologies and gamification we think that the exercise can become more interesting and can help 
physiotherapist to control the right patient movement with extreme precision. 

The application is divided in two part: Desktop and VR.
The Desktop part is developed for physiotherapist, where he can select patient, body part, set up trakers, register the right exercise and
control right movement of every limb part.
The VR part is for patient: with HTC Vive headset and trakers he can do the exercise in a funny world that help him to do the right movement
with realtime simulations and informations.

### Setup trakers
Physiotherapist, after placing trakers, can active them by touching them with HTC Vive controller. After touch, the circle of limb part
became green.

### Registration exercise
Now physioterapist can explain the exercise to the patient and register the correct sample. The system during the registration store 
the positions of the trakers every frame.

### Trakers feedback
Finally patient can do exercise alone in VR and the system report to Desktop which limb part is correct and which not. In the 3D
world patient have a magic sphere that indicate him the right way for every limb part.

## VR
During the exercise, patient with HTC Vive headset, controls and trakers can do the right movement thanks to the magics balls that 
suggest him every limb part positions.
